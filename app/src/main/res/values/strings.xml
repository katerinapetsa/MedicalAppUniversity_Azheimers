    <string name="what_is_Title">Alzheimer\'s Disease\n</string>
    <string name="what_is_1">Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain
        disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability
        to carry out the simplest tasks. In most people with the disease—those with the late-onset
        type—symptoms first appear in their mid-60s. Early-onset Alzheimer’s occurs between a person’s
        30s and mid-60s and is very rare. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia among
        older adults.</string>
    <string name="what_is_2">The disease is named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer. In 1906, Dr. Alzheimer
        noticed changes in the brain tissue of a woman who had died of an unusual mental illness.
        Her symptoms included memory loss, language problems, and unpredictable behavior. After she
        died, he examined her brain and found many abnormal clumps (now called amyloid plaques) and
        tangled bundles of fibers (now called neurofibrillary, or tau, tangles).</string>


    <string name="what_is_3">These plaques and tangles in the brain are still considered some of the
        main features of Alzheimer’s disease. Another feature is the loss of connections between
        nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. Neurons transmit messages between different parts of the
        brain, and from the brain to muscles and organs in the body. Many other complex brain changes
        are thought to play a role in Alzheimer’s, too.</string>

    <string name="what_is_4">This damage initially appears to take place in the hippocampus, the
        part of the brain essential in forming memories. As neurons die, additional parts of the brain
        are affected. By the final stage of Alzheimer’s, damage is widespread, and brain tissue has
        shrunk significantly.</string>



    <string name="causes_Title">Causes\n</string>
    <string name="causes_1">Like all types of dementia, Alzheimer\'s is caused by brain cell death.
        It is a neurodegenerative disease, which means there is progressive brain cell death that happens over time.
    </string>
    <string name="causes_2">Risk factors:</string>
    <string name="causes_3">Unavoidable risk factors for developing the condition include:\n
        aging, a family history of Alzheimer\'s, carrying certain genes.
    </string>
    <string name="causes_4">Modifiable factors that may help prevent Alzheimers include:\n
         •  getting regular exercise\n
         •  maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system\n
         •  following a varied and healthful diet\n
         •  participating in lifelong learning and cognitive training\n
        Some studies suggest that staying mentally and socially engaged may possibly reduce the risk of Alzheimers.\n
    </string>



    <string name="symptom_Title">Symptoms\n</string>
    <string name="symptom_1">The cognitive decline must be seen in at least two of the five symptom areas listed below:</string>
    <string name="symptom_2"><b>Symptoms of MG can include:</b>\n
        •  repetitive questions or conversations\n
        •  misplacing personal belonging\n
        •  forgetting events or appointments\n
        •  getting lost on a familiar route\n
        •  poor understanding of safety risks\n
        •  inability to recognize faces or common objects or to find objects in direct view\n
        •  inability to use simple tools, for example, to orient clothing to the body\n
        •  difficulty thinking of common words while speaking, hesitations\n
        •  out-of-character mood changes, including agitation, apathy, social withdrawal or a lack of interest, motivation, or initiative\n
        •  loss of empathy\n
        •  compulsive, obsessive, or socially unacceptable behavior\n
    </string>
    <string name="symptom_3">Alzheimer\'s is most likely when memory loss is a prominent symptom, especially in the area of learning and recalling new information.\n</string>


    <string name="diagnosis_Title">Diagnosis\n</string>
    <string name="diagnosis_1">There is no single test for Alzheimers disease, so doctors will
        look at the signs and symptoms, take a medical history, and rule out other conditions before
        making a diagnosis. Sometimes the symptoms of dementia are related to an inherited disorder
        such as Huntingtons disease, so genetic testing may be done. After ruling out other
        possible conditions, the doctor will carry out cognitive and memory tests, to assess
        the persons ability to think and remember.\n</string>
    <string name="diagnosis_2">Cognitive Assesment.To confirm a diagnosis of Alzheimer\'s, the following
        must be present and severe enough to affect daily activities:\n
        •  gradual memory loss\n
        •  progressive cognitive impairment\n

    </string>
    <string name="diagnosis_3">Genetic testing
        In some cases, genetic testing may be appropriate.
        A gene known as the APOE-e4 is associated with higher chances of people over the age of 55 years developing Alzheimer\'s.
        Using this test early could indicate the likelihood of someone having or developing the disease.
        However, the test is controversial, and the results are not entirely reliable.\n
    </string>

    <string name="treatment_Title">Treatment\n</string>
    <string name="treatment_1">Alzheimer’s disease is complex, and it is unlikely that any one
        drug or other intervention will successfully treat it. Current approaches focus on helping
        people maintain mental function, manage behavioral symptoms, and slow down the symptoms of
        disease.</string>
    <string name="treatment_2_medication">•	<b>Treatment for Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s: </b>\n
         Medications called cholinesterase inhibitors are prescribed for mild to moderate Alzheimer’s
        disease. These drugs may help reduce some symptoms and help control some behavioral symptoms.
        Scientists do not yet fully understand how cholinesterase inhibitors work to treat Alzheimer’s
        disease, but research indicates that they prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine, a brain
        chemical believed to be important for memory and thinking. </string>
    <string name="treatment_3_thymectomy">•	<b>Treatment for Moderate to Severe Alzheimer’s: </b>\n
        A medication known as Namenda® (memantine), an N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, is
        prescribed to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. This drug’s main effect is to
        decrease symptoms, which could allow some people to maintain certain daily functions a little
        longer than they would without the medication.</string>



    <string name="complications_Title">Complications of Myasthenia Gravis\n</string>
    <string name="complications">One of the most dangerous potential complications of MG is
        myasthenic crisis. This consists of life-threatening muscle weakness that can include
        breathing problems or cause the person to have difficulty breathing on their own.\n\n
        The long term use of steroids can cause\n
        • Osteoporosis\n
        • Cataract\n
        • Hyperglycemia\n
        • Weight gain\n
        • Hypertension\n
        • Gastritis or peptic ulcer disease\n\n
        Individuals with MG are at a higher risk of developing other autoimmune disorders such as
        rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.\n
    </string>

    <string name="epidemiology_Title">Epidemiology\n</string>
    <string name="epidemiology">An annual incidence rate of MG is thought to be between 0.25 and 20
        per 1,000,000 population.\n\n
        MG can affect both genders and all races. Previous studies have shown that women are more
        often affected than men. For women, the most common age at onset is between second and
        fourth decades of life. For men the onset of symptoms is usually after the age of 50.\n\n
        In Cyprus it is estimated at 1 per 2,500 population, approximately 300 cases.\n\n
        However, Myasthenia Gravis remains underdiagnosed and the prevalence is probably higher.\n
    </string>

    <string name="long_term_Title">Long-term outlook\n</string>
    <string name="long_term1">The long-term outlook for MG depends on a lot of factors. Some people
        will only have mild symptoms. Others may eventually become confined to a wheelchair.</string>
    <string name="long_term2">Talk to your doctor about what you can do to minimize the severity of your MG. Early and
        proper treatment can limit disease progression in many people.\n</string>
